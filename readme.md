# Compressor Head

Compressor Head is a web application for compressing/scaling an image before downloading it.
It is built on [Python](https://www.python.org) and hosted on the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

## Why Compressor Head?

Compressor Head compresses images to the desired resolution before passing these images back to the user to download. This saves data and storage resources. So this has a twin benefit.

Running on the Google App Engine, the image conversion is nearly instantaneous. The usage of the Memcache library also speeds up the conversion process if the same image had been retrieved before.

### <a id="usage"></a>Usage

*URL* - 
```http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=[IMAGE_URL]&width=[WIDTH]&height=[HEIGHT]&format=[FORMAT]```

Where
```
*IMAGE_URL* is the URL of the image to be compressed.
*WIDTH* is the desired width.
*HEIGHT* is the desired height.
*FORMAT* is the desired image format (Supported formats - JPEG, PNG and WEBP).
```

Both WIDTH and HEIGHT should be integers greater than or equal to 0:
 * If *both are 0*, the image will not be scaled.
 * If *one of the two is 0*, it will scale that non-zero dimension and the other dimension will be scaled such that the aspect ratio remains the same.
 * If *both are greater than 0*, both the width and height will scale so, which may change the aspect ratio of the image.

### <a id="usage_exm"></a>Usage example

Sample Image URL - http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image
This is a `5.8 MB JPEG` image, with dimensions of `5649Ã—3684`
![](http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image)

To resize the image -
- Resize (Width) : `http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image&width=500&height=0&format=jpeg`
Note: This retains the aspect ratio of the image, and the height is scaled so.

![](http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image&width=500&height=0&format=jpeg)

This returns an image `37 KB JPEG` image with dimensions `500x326`

- Resize (Height) : `http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image&width=0&height=250&format=png`
Note: This retains the aspect ratio of the image, and the width is scaled so.

![](http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image&width=0&height=250&format=png)

This returns an image `164 KB PNG` image with dimensions `383x250`

- Resize (Width & Height) : `http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image&width=500&height=350&format=jpeg`
Note: This may change the aspect ratio of the image.

![](http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image&width=500&height=350&format=jpeg)

This returns an image `41 KB JPEG` image with dimensions `500x350`

**Note:** You can also use the `WEBP` format, but it's not shown as an example as GitHub does not make WEBPs. A sample WEBP conversion of this conversion could be found [here](http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image/?image_url=http://compressor-head.appspot.com/image&width=500&height=350&format=webp).
